what do we want to test?

  white noise over a 440Hz sine wave *
  
  ref=noise (perfect measurement) to demonstrate mu=1 optimal in such cases *

  square wave noise *
 
  sine wave noise ?

  more complex signals/noises
    periodic and musical, crowd noise, car noise

  different tap sizes

  different delays, w/ different types of noise
    exactly half-phase delay w/ clean periodic noise/signal, what happens? do things happen? let's find out
